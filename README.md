## Telco Churn and Classification: What really matters?

### This repository includes a jupyter notebook, titled Telco_Final.ipynb, that contains  the full data science pipeline to build a model for probability of churn in our customer base.

### a prepare.py file is included to format the data for this process correctly in the name of replicability.  **Note: the user will still need to split and scale the data if they want to fully replicate process.  See first cells in notebook for reference to this.  Standard min-max scaler utilized for continuous float data.
